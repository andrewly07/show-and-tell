            <h2 class="section-title">I'm a collector.</h2>
            <p>This has always been a passion and hobby of mine for as long as I can remember.</p>
            <p>I want anything that's exclusive or rare, from clothing, art, figures, NFTs and comics—you name it!</p>
            <p>Specifically, the hunt for the next great find is what I love most about collecting. Whether I'm at a dusty old comic book store in the middle of nowhere, scrolling through an online auction, or sifting through bins at a collectibles show, there’s an undeniable thrill in the search. </p>
            <p>But it's not just about what I'm looking for; it's about the entire experience. From the smell of old paper, the shared passion with other collectors, and the unique stories behind each piece. When I finally find that rare art piece or that classic comic book, it feels like a victory.</p>
            <p>I suppose they’re a tangible connection to the things I love, and a way to hold on to a bit of nostalgia. For me, collecting is a hobby that’s as much about the past as it is about the present, and it brings me a lot of joy.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">My most recent collecting obsession is grading & selling PSA cards</h2>
            <p>I've collected some Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and One Piece trading cards. I'd highly recommend PSA or BGS as your third-party grading service as they are the most reputable.  </p>
        <p>Here are a few gems from my personal collection! </p>
<div class="container">
 <div class="psa-row">
    <div class="psa-items-container">
        <div class="flex-img"> <img src="img/2000-pokemon-neo-genesis-14-slowking-holo-1st-edition-nm-7-68222.webp"></div>
       

        <div class="padding-left flex-text">
            <p><b>PSA 7 1st edition Slowking #14</b></p> 
            <p>This card is valued at around $130 - $150. Which isn't bad for a 1st edition copy of an older set, but the PSA 10 version was recently sold for $12,500!</p> 
            
        </div>

    </div>
    <div class="psa-items-container">
        <div class="flex-img"> <img src="img/s-l1200.jpg"></div>
       

        <div class="padding-left flex-text">
            <p><b>PSA 10 Valkyrion the Magna Warrior (SDD-001)</b></p> 
            <p>This is valued roughly ~$240 as a PSA 10, but considering I bought it on eBay for under $20, it's a pretty fair trade in my opinion.</p> 
        
        </div>

    </div>
    <div class="psa-items-container">
        <div class="flex-img"> <img src="img/prod-1_front_PSA_123059039_20250817234228477.jpeg"></div>
       

        <div class="padding-left flex-text">
            <p><b>PSA 10 Dodgers x One Piece Night</b></p> 
            <p>This was from an exclusive event that I was able to pick up at the Dodgers stadium. It's the most valuable card currently in my collection currently valued around $1,600</p> 
        </div>

    </div>

<p>As the card collecting craze continues to grow, I have no doubt that the price of my collection will as well (I don't encourage gambling, but if you're going to gamble anyway might as well do it on something you love). </p>

              <h2 class="section-title">Now For 5 Fun Facts!</h2>
              <p>1. I used to co-host a developer podcast with a friend where we would talk about code and explain topics to newbies who were interested in breaking into the tech world. Sadly we had to cancel it after 40+ episodes due to schedule changes.</p>
              <p>2. I am an avid writer and reader. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gods-Machine-1-Andrew-Ly/dp/0991444701">I wrote and published a YA fantasy novel a while ago and you can find it on Amazon!</a>  I was midway with penning the sequel before life got in the way and I never got back to it. I still have artwork for the eventual comic version too.</p>
              <p>3. I enjoy photography! Especially capturing portraits, landscapes, & cyberpunk cityscapes.</p>
              <p>4. I love coffee and exploring new coffee shops wherever I go. So definitely shoot me a recommendation of your favorite coffee shops!</p>
              <p>5. I like visiting art museums + book stores. If it's aesthetically pleasing <i>and </i>also contains a coffee shop nearby, I'm having a good day. </p>

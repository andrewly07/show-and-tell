            <h2 class="section-title">I'm a collector.</h2>
            <p>This has always been a passion and hobby of mine for as long as I can remember.</p>
            <p>I want anything that's exclusive or rare, from clothing, art, figures, and comics—you name it!</p>
            <p>Specifically, the hunt for the next great find is what I love most about collecting. Whether I'm at a dusty old comic book store in the middle of nowhere, scrolling through an online auction, or sifting through bins at a collectibles show, there’s an undeniable thrill in the search. </p>
            <p>But it's not just about what I'm looking for; it's about the entire experience. From the smell of old paper, the shared passion with other collectors, and the unique stories behind each piece. When I finally find that rare art piece or that classic comic book, it feels like a victory.</p>
            <p>I suppose they’re a tangible connection to the things I love, and a way to hold on to a bit of nostalgia. For me, collecting is a hobby that’s as much about the past as it is about the present, and it brings me a lot of joy.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">My most recent collecting obsession is grading & selling PSA cards</h2>
            <p>I've collected some Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and One Piece trading cards. I'd highly recommend PSA or BGS as your third-party grading service as they are the most reputable.  </p>
        <p>Here are a few gems from my personal collection! </p>
<div class="container">

        <div class="flex-img"> <img src="img/2000-pokemon-neo-genesis-14-slowking-holo-1st-edition-nm-7-68222.webp"></div>
       

        <div class="padding-left flex-text">
            <p><b>PSA 7 1st edition Slowking #14</b></p> 
            <p>This card is valued at around $130 - $150. Which isn't bad for a 1st edition copy of an older set, but the PSA 10 version was recently sold for $12,500!</p> 
            
        </div>

    <div class="psa-items-container">
        <div class="flex-img"> <img src="img/s-l1200.jpg"></div>
       

        <div class="padding-left flex-text">
            <p><b>PSA 10 Valkyrion the Magna Warrior (SDD-001)</b></p> 
            <p>This sold pretty recently for $240 as a PSA 10, but considering I bought it on eBay for under $20, it's a pretty fair trade in my opinion.</p> 
        
        </div>

        <div class="padding-left flex-text">
            <p><b>PSA 10 Dodgers x One Piece Night</b></p> 
            <p>This was from an exclusive event that I was able to pick up at the Dodgers stadium. It's the most valuable card currently in my collection currently valued between $1,200 - $1,600</p> 
        </div>

</div>
<p>As the card collecting craze continues to grow, I have no doubt that the price of my collection will as well. </p>

              <h2 class="section-title">Now For Five Fun Facts!</h2><span class="byline">
              <p>I also enjoy a few hobbies aside from collecting and hunting for shiny cardboad.  </p>
              <p>Number one, I used to co-host a developer podcast with a friend where we would talk about code and explain topics to newbies who were interested in breaking into the tech world. Sadly we had to cancel it after 40+ episodes.</p>
              <p>Number two, I am an avid writer and reader. I wrote and published a YA fantasy novel a while ago and you can find it on Amazon! I was midway with penning the sequel before life got in the way and I never got back to it. I still have artwork for the eventual comic version too.</p>
              <p>Number three, I enjoy photography! Especially capturing portraits,landscapes, & cityscapes</p>
              <p>Number four, I love coffee and exploring new coffee shops wherever I go. So definitely shoot me a recommendation of your favorite coffee shops!</p>
              <p>Number five, </p>
